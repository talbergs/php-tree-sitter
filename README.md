# About

PHP bindings for the famous [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) library, thanks to FFI (available since php 7.4).

By using this library you can:
- create static code analysis tools
- automate refactoring
- create a language server
- .. _your idea_

# Install

Version must be specified when requiring unstable packages:

```bash
composer require talbergs/tree-sitter=0.19.0-rc3
composer require talbergs/tree-sitter-php=0.19.0-rc3
composer require talbergs/tree-sitter-html=0.19.0-rc3
```

Requirements:

- ext-ffi
- php >= 8.0

# Basic usage

> For more extensive examples see [./examples](./examples) directory.

```php
$parser = TS\Parser::new();
$parser->setLanguage(TS\Language::php());
$tree = $parser->parseString(null, '<?php $code;');
var_dump($tree->getRootNode());
```

# Used by

> Your project, if using this binding will be plugged here as well, just open a ticket or submit PR.

- https://github.com/talbergs/php-language-server-lsp - PHP Language Server (implements LSP)

# Mono repo

> Yes this is mono repo to ease dev.

- This means all packages will have **the same** version.
- This means all packages are testable all together.
- This means `packagist` will remain in many, many `[read-only]` repositories (as a workaround for [packagist.org](packagist.org) approach).

# To do:
- [ ] cross compile (new just few builds are available and not tested)
- [ ] create a way to load grammar source files as language (non performant, for grammar development purposes).
- [x] provide some working examples
- [ ] coverage (100%)
- [ ] check if all malloc's are freed
- [ ] Investigation [#1](https://blog.logrocket.com/hosting-all-your-php-packages-together-in-a-monorepo/), [#2](https://github.com/symplify/monorepo-builder)

# Versioning

> binding is versioned along with TS & grammar versions.

Using [semantic versioning standard](https://semver.org/).
- MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version corresponds to [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) the build of parsing library and their grammars.
- Pre-release version affix `-` is used to denote incremental improvement to this bindings library.
-- backwards incompatible changes are MAJOR
-- memory leak fixes are MAJOR
-- additional builds are considered MINOR
-- additional methods are considered MINOR
-- coding style changes are PATCH

i.e. `0.19.0-1.3.22`
